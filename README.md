# BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that helps users determine their BMI based on weight and height. BMI is a widely used tool to assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This tool provides an easy and quick way to calculate BMI and categorize it according to the standard BMI classification.

Features
Calculates BMI based on user input (weight in kg and height in meters).
Categorizes the result into: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.
Simple and intuitive user interface.

How It Works
The BMI is calculated using the formula:

scss
Copy code
BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m) * height(m))
Once the BMI value is calculated, it is classified into one of the following categories:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI >= 30
